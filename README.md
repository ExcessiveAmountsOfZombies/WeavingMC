# WeavingMC
Fabric server event system &amp; more?


idea is that sponge/forge/bukkit all have event systems, and fabric kinda does too but this adds one that's similar to the other three. Will anyone use it? will i continue working on it? do i have the knowledge to make something like this?

we'll call it weavingMC because we're so hilarious basing the name of a mod on the idea of "weaving" and "fabric" hilarious! if anyone uses this maybe we'll update the readme too

this event system uses code based based on lahwran's fast events and then modified a bit to allow for annotation based priority and cancellation similar to forge/bukkit actually.
